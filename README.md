# Assignment

1. Candidate Performance Overview:

Average, minimum, and maximum scores across all tests.

2. Distribution of candidate scores 

Percentage of candidates in each performance category (Beginner, Intermediate, Experienced, Proficient).

3. Test Performance Analysis:

Average scores for each test 

4. Section-wise Performance:

Number of correct, incorrect, and unanswered questions per section.

5. Candidate Feedback Analysis:

Correlation between feedback and test performance.

6. Proctoring and Violations :
   Impact of violations on test scores

7. Section Difficulty Analysis:
   Comparison of section difficulty across different tests.



#Diagnostic Analytics (Stretch Goal)
1. Performance Correlation Analysis:

Investigate the correlation between time taken to complete the test and the final score. Are candidates who take longer performing better or worse?

"I found that candidates who took longer to complete the test tended to score higher, suggesting that more time allows for better performance. However, candidates who took too long  did not perform as well, possibly due to fatigue or overthinking.

2. Feedback Impact Analysis:

 if there is a relationship between candidate feedback and their performance. Are candidates who provide positive feedback performing better?

Candidates who provided positive feedback generally scored higher, indicating that a positive test experience may correlate with better performance. This could be due to higher confidence or better preparation.

3. Violation Impact Analysis:

Analyze the impact of proctoring violations on test scores.

Candidates flagged for proctoring violations scored, on average, 10% lower than those without violations. This suggests that violations may be a sign of stress or lack of preparation, impacting performance.

4. Section Difficulty Impact:

Investigate if certain sections are consistently more difficult for candidates, leading to lower scores. Are there patterns in which sections are causing the most difficulty?

The SQL Coding section had the lowest average score, indicating it may be more challenging for candidates. This could be due to the complexity of the questions or a lack of preparation in this area.

5. Test Design Analysis:

Evaluate if the test design is impacting candidate performance. Are candidates running out of time, or are they finishing too quickly?

Candidates often ran out of time in the Aptitude & LR section, indicating that the time allocated may be insufficient. Adjusting the time limit could improve overall performance.
